Welcome to the 2009 CAEPA conference — Partnering For a Better Colorado. The board chose this theme in order to emphasize two areas in which our partnerships could be strengthened. First, we would like to reach out to each member and create a stronger partnership in the field. Let us know how we can benefit you in your locales. What would you like to see your professional association do for your program? In turn, what strengths could you contribute to our organization? Secondly, we are working to partner with businesses and foundations so that our programs can be more effective in the midst of shrinking budgets. Resources exist; let’s forge partnerships to access these resources in our communities.

The amount of effort it takes to develop this conference is enormous! Fortunately, many people play a part in making Rendezvous a success. Our gratitude goes to Pam Smith and her staff at Colorado Department of Education for their essential support to Rendezvous. Thanks to each presenter who works to share his/her expertise in the breakout sessions as well as to the vendors for bringing their material and making donations to our programs. We appreciate the Colorado SUN Grant Team for joining our conference and sharing Steve Hinds with us. In addition, we are indebted to Richard Male’s direction in helping us create partnerships within the community.

Last of all, thanks to the CAEPA Board of Directors who donate hundreds of hours communicating with vendors, determining award winners, designing the program, collating evaluations, arranging the schedule, gathering prizes, working with the hotel, and the many other tasks that surround conference planning. Not only does the Board work untold hours on the conference, we have also worked to put our marketing pieces in place. Our new mission statement and new logo help give us a fresh look as we create community partners. Our new website is continuing to be developed; check it regularly for updates—and contribute! Send us pictures of your program’s events and articles relating to adult education so that we can strengthen our partnership with you!

Thanks for coming. Enjoy the presentations and enjoy mingling with fellow adult educators throughout the state.
