Welcome to Rendezvous 2007 and "Engaging Diverse Learners." The CAEPA Board is pleased that you have chosen to join us and your Colorado colleagues at the premier professional development conference for adult educators.

This year’s conference features a diverse array of presentations representative of the diversity of students and programs in Colorado. We have two very prominent speakers from our field for our opening session and Friday luncheon. Dr. Raymond J. Wlodkowski is an internationally-known adult educator and author of several books on motivation and learning. Dr. Chuck Luna, Ed. D is Co-Director of the Rocky Mountain Cultural Institute, which provides intercultural competency skills training in the U.S. Both of these dynamic professionals will give us all a better understanding of how we engage and serve our diverse adult student population.

We’d like to remind you that we have a great selection of silent auction items up for bid, so please make a bid on your favorite item and help support CAEPA. Remember to buy your raffle tickets for the week in Cancun, Mexico! Raffle tickets can be purchased at the registration desk.

While you're going to great presentations, bidding on silent auction items, and crossing your fingers for the raffle prize, be sure to visit our many vendors and publishers on the garden level.

Finally, putting on a conference such as this takes a lot of hard work and dedication from a group of professionals who put in the extra time to make this conference a success every year. I want to thank the entire CAEPA Board for all of their hard work as well as the many individuals at the Colorado Department of Education who have worked on Rendezvous 2007.

I’d like to especially recognize Margie Wagner, our current President-elect and future President, for the incredible amount of time she has given this year. She has gone above and beyond to ensure that we again offer you an outstanding conference.

The CAEPA Board hopes you enjoy the conference and come away with great ideas to bring to your programs, classes, and students.
