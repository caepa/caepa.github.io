On behalf of the CAEPA Board of Directors, welcome to Rendezvous 2008 – Sharing Success: Adult Learners in Transition! Each year colleagues from across the state take this opportunity to come together to share knowledge and talents, develop new skills, and exchange ideas. We are eager to present another excellent professional conference!

It is an honor to host this year’s Keynote Speaker, Dr. Peter Waite, Executive Director of ProLiteracy America and Vice President of U.S. Programs for ProLiteracy Worldwide. Dr. Waite has worked in a variety of adult education settings and has held positions from volunteer to consultant. We are also excited to feature two other nationally recognized presenters, Nancie Payne, specialist in learning and cognitive disabilities, and Dr. Marilyn Gillespie, adult literacy education consultant.

Our conference this year features 46 workshops in eleven different strands: Administration & Advocacy, Corrections, ESL, Family Literacy, General Teaching ABE/GED, Immigration, Learning Disabilities, Math, Professional Development, Reading & Writing, and Transitions. We owe a debt of gratitude to our colleagues who have spent significant time and effort to share their expertise with us.

Planning a conference takes time, effort, and dedication. I would like to thank the entire CAEPA Board for their hard work, brilliant ideas, and countless contributions, and the Colorado Department of Education Adult and Family Literacy for their extensive support. Thanks also to our contracted help, Finer Points Planning and ChurchMouse Media.

Our goal is to continue to improve and inspire our field - please enjoy Rendezvous 2008!
