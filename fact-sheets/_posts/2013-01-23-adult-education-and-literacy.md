**Colorado is the only state that does not set aside state dollars for Adult Education!**

  * **Adults with no High School credential:** 340,360\\
  10.1% of Colorado’s workforce is not prepared for post-secondary education or middle-skill jobs. [^1]
  * **Adults who do not speak English:** 157,455\\
  3% of adult working population, some with post-secondary credentials, cannot fill available jobs in critical sectors. [^2]
  * **Colorado High School Seniors not graduating "one-time":** 15,006\\
  24.6% of the 2012 graduating class requires remediation not available in the CO Higher Education system. [^3]

**Yet only 3% (10,8124) of those that would benefit from services were able to enroll in 2012!** [^4]

Note:  data as of 2012

### Additional economic impact of underfunding Adult Education programs includes:

  * Significantly higher unemployment (14% for those w/no H.S. credential, only 8% for those w/Associate’s degree) [^5]
  * Lower taxable income and increased social services (each non-graduate costs CO $524,000 - lifetime average) [^6]
  * Increased recidivism and lower employment rate upon release for inmates w/out academic or vocational training. [^7]
  * 34% of Colorado’s children in non-English immigrant families live in poverty and 11% suffer extreme poverty, reducing K-12 academic success and increasing dropout rates. [^8]

### Adult Education programs fill critical education gaps between High School and Higher Education with services that:

  * Provide literacy and numeracy training (Increasing service to include those no longer served by community colleges due to recent cutbacks.)
  * Prepare Coloradans to be job-ready for middle-skill careers (those requiring more than high school yet less than university degrees; currently a critical need in Colorado’s workforce.)
  * Collaborate with Workforce centers and function as pathways to post-secondary opportunities
  * Connect families with vital resources to stop the cycle of poverty and incarceration
  * Educate citizens so they can make informed civic, financial, and health care decisions
  * Incorporate the National Common Core Standards to meet the needs of a 21st century workforce.

**Without appropriate funding, instructional offerings are limited, program wait lists are long, and critical industry sectors continue to hire from out-of-state due to lack of skilled workers!**
