Are gestures the universal language that can help language learners and teachers communicate? We will be discussing how gestures can be helpful, but also how they can be terribly confusing to ELLs.","Gesture and language are a single, unified, cognitive system (McNeill, 1992).  Researchers from various backgrounds such as psychology, anthropology, cognitive science, child language acquisition, and more recently, teaching pedagogy support this theory. Until recently, researchers often dismissed the connection between gesture and second language acquisition (SLA) because gesture was thought to be less quantifiable than other linguistic elements. That being said, educators are fascinated with gesture and often use gesture in the classroom to help with communication. The present study investigates the communicative strength of speech plus gesture communication of second language (L2) users of English. Research in psychology shows that gesture, rather than speech, is better remembered over time. The current study is a replication of that research. The results differ: gestures that supply additional information are not communicatively helpful to L2 users. In fact, gesture can be distracting. The present study demonstrates why language educators should consider only certain types of gesture in the classroom.
