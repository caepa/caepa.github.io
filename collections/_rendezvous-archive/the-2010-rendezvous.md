Welcome to the 2010 CAEPA Conference – The Power of Adult Learning! Each year colleagues from across the state take this opportunity to come together to share knowledge and talents, develop new skills, and exchange ideas. This year’s conference features an assorted collection of presentations representative of the diversity of students and programs in Colorado. We owe a debt of gratitude to our presenters, who have spent significant time and effort to share their expertise with us. We are also thankful for our vendors and exhibitors for bringing their materials and making donations to our programs and to this conference.

Planning a conference takes time, effort, and dedication. I would like to thank the entire CAEPA Board for all of their hard work and countless contributions – from communicating with vendors to gathering silent auction items to determining award winners and scholarship recipients to editing the program – it truly takes a village! I would especially like to recognize Orly Penny, our President-Elect, for the incredible amount of time she has given this year. She has gone above and beyond to ensure that we again offer you an outstanding conference. A special word of appreciation to the Colorado Department of Education for the many ways they support adult education throughout the state. Without their support, this conference would not be possible.

As you pass by the registration desk during this conference, please thank Betty Carson, CAEPA's Treasurer for the past 25 years, for everything that she has given to this organization. This is Betty's last Rendezvous as a member of the CAEPA board; we will surely miss her leadership and her guidance.

The CAEPA Board hopes you enjoy the conference and come away with great ideas to bring to your programs, classes, and students. Our goal is to continue to improve and inspire our field – please enjoy Rendezvous 2010!
