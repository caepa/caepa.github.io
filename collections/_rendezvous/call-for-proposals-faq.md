Session leader biography

If the session will include co-leaders, provide a bio for each. If the session will have more than three session co-leaders, provide a bio for the primary leader and a general description of the remaining team members. Biographies will be published in our program and online. (600 characters)

Session information
: We will ask for your availability and how many session blocks your proposal requires. **Session blocks are 75 minutes in length.**

Additional information
: Optionally, in up to 200 words, include specific requirements, such as laptop or software downloads or skill-set prerequisites, or anything else you think we need to know. Information here will not be published. (1200 characters)

## How long are sessions? or How much time will I have for a session?

Session blocks will be **75 minutes** in length, subject to program committee decisions and scheduling logistics.

## What if I get started on the proposal form and cannot finish it in one sitting?

We recommend that you prepare your responses in a separate document and copy/paste them into the submission form once the information is fully prepared. However, it is possible to edit a proposal once you have finished the proposal process. Contact <rendezvous@caepa.org> if edits are required.

## What happens after I submit my proposal?

You will see a confirmation screen after you submit your proposal and receive a confirmation email. A CAEPA committee will review all proposals during the month of August. **Session leaders will be notified via email regarding the status of their proposals.** If selected, we will ask for a Session leader biography.

## What technology does CAEPA provide?

CAEPA provides a projector and standard cable, basic classroom tech support and wireless connectivity in each session room. We regret that **we cannot** provide instructor stations or laptops, flash drives, or Mac projector DVI connectors/cables. **CAEPA is a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) event for all.**
