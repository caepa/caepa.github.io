## How long are sessions? or How much time will I have for a session?

Session lengths will be **45 minutes** in length, subject to program committee decisions and scheduling logistics.

## What if I get started on the proposal form and cannot finish it in one sitting?

We recommend that you prepare your responses in a separate document and copy/paste them into the submission form once the information is fully prepared. However, it is possible to edit a proposal once you have finished the proposal process. Contact <rendezvous@caepa.org> if edits are required.

## What happens after I submit my proposal?

You will see a confirmation screen after you submit your proposal and receive a confirmation email. A CAEPA committee will review all proposals during the month of September. **Session leaders will be notified via email by September 15 regarding the status of their proposals.** Session leaders whose proposals are accepted will need to register at the discounted registration rate.

## What technology does CAEPA provide?

CAEPA provides a projector and standard cable, basic classroom tech support and wireless connectivity in each session room. We regret that we cannot provide instructor stations or laptops, flashdrives, or Mac projector DVI connectors/cables. CAEPA 2018 is a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) event for all.
