### Session 1 choices

**Centers-based ESL classes – Sierra Hutchinson**

Centers include clearly focused activities that foster skill development and content knowledge as well as self-directed learning. Learn how to apply these techniques in your ESL class.

**Learner Persistence: A change in behavior  -  Cara Messick**

Participants will evaluate a change model for mapping learner persistence of their students.

### Session 2 choices

**The Basic Alphabetics Test and Tools – Dorothea Steinke**

How do you know whether zero-English students have any idea of the sound/symbol connection? This tool, which was developed by ESL teachers in Minnesota, gives you a place to start.

**The Mind’s Immersion in Learning – Ariel Shakely**

Teaching a second language starts with trust. Once that bond is established, languages skills are built upon by connecting structure to meaning. How do we brush the dust off of grammar and vocab, in order to connect students to the living pulse of language? Lastly, practice makes perfect, but all practice is not created equally.

**Phrasal Verbs – Alex Bricker**

Engage English Language Learners with commonly used phrasal verbs in English by using Phrase It.

Join this hands-on presentation and discover methods for playing Phrase It™ through speaking, writing, and a kinesthetic activity. The goal for English language learners is to practice the tricky part of English: phrasal verbs. During the last few minutes of the presentation, there will be a drawing for a free deck of Phrase It cards, a coffee mug for teachers, and an opportunity for you to provide your professional feedback.

### Session 3 choices

**Selecting appropriate textbooks for adult ESL - Kat Bradley-Bennett**

Many factors should be considered when selecting a core text or supplementary materials. In this hands-on workshop, we’ll look at some popular text and weigh them against a checklist of criteria for adult ESL.

**The Change Curve: a tool to aid adjustment to a new culture – Fabiana Nardi**

The change curve is a leadership tool that can be applied to different types of situations. It is a very helpful concept that tutors/teachers can use to support refugees and new immigrants when they have just arrived in a different country/culture.

**Basic Building-Blocks to Reading Comprehension, Writing and Critical Thinking Skills – Ranee Cervania**

This workshop will provide participants key basic building-blocks that will empower ESL students to improve their reading comprehension, writing and critical thinking skills.  Participants will also learn key basic tutoring strategies that will help create and facilitate a productive and interactive learning environment, enabling students to become independent learners.  Participants will experience first-hand various interactive learning activities illustrating how these strategies are applied.
