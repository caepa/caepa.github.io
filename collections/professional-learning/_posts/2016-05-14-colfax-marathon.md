You and your staff have the opportunity to raise awareness for CAEPA by running or walking the Colfax marathon on May 14 and May 15. George O'Clair has been doing this for years and is asking for your support. By signing up for the 5k walk (3.1 miles) you can help support our efforts in acquiring a spot and a tent to publicize CAEPA by purchasing a race spot. This is for Adult Education awareness around the entire state of Colorado. The runners will be provided t-shirts to wear to advertise CAEPA.

Please go to [www.runcolfax.org](http://www.runcolfax.org) and select CAEPA when you are asked the question "do you plan to raise funds and awareness to a charity partner?"

If you should have questions, please call George at [1-970-542-3238](phone:1-970-542-3238).

Thank you for considering being a part of this activity.
