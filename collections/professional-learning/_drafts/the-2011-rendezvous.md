Welcome to the 2011 CAEPA Conference – Maximizing Resources in Challenging Times! Each year
colleagues from across this great state take the opportunity to come together to share knowledge and  talents, develop new skills and exchange ideas. We are especially excited to hear our dynamic keynote speakers – Bethanie Tucker, EdD and Temple Grandin, PhD – who will share their wisdom, experience and true passion for lifelong learning.

This year’s conference features an assorted collection of presentations representative of the diversity of students and programs in Colorado and beyond. We owe a debt of gratitude to our presenters, who have spent significant time and energy to share their expertise with us. We are also thankful to our vendors and exhibitors for making their materials available and providing donations to our programs and annual conference.

Planning a conference takes time, effort and dedication. I would like to thank everyone on the  CAEPA Board for their hard work and countless contributions – from communicating with vendors to gathering silent auction items to determining award winners and scholarship recipients to editing the program – it truly takes a village! Also, a special word of appreciation to the Adult Education and Family Literacy staff at the Colorado Department of Education for the many ways they champion adult education throughout the state. This conference would not be possible without their support.

In addition, welcome and thank you to Ann Leonard, CAEPA's new Assistant to the Board of Directors. Ann jumped right into conference planning and hasn't looked back! I would also like to recognize Orly Penny, CAEPA's President-Elect, for again going above and beyond to ensure that we offer you all an outstanding conference. Finally, a special thank you to Glenda Sinks, CAEPA's Past President, who will step off the CAEPA board after nine years. Glenda is a mentor and a friend, while also being the resident historian and go-to bylaws expert. Thank you for everything you have given to CAEPA, Glenda! You will be missed.

The CAEPA Board hopes you enjoy the conference and come away with great ideas to bring to your programs, classes and students. Our goal is to continue to improve and inspire our field – please enjoy Rendezvous 2011!
