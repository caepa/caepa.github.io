Hello CAEPA members and welcome to your CAEPA mini-conference. Your CAEPA board of directors has been hard at work organizing this conference.

A year ago the CAEPA board of directors consisted of four members.  Today the board of directors consists of 16 and we are hoping to soon have 21 directors. We will follow this conference with another conference in October located in Denver, Colorado.

I, George Oâ€™Clair, would like to thank all the board of directors for their hard work during this last year as it has not been easy.  I want to thank CDE-AEI for being a big part of the board of directors and conference.  I would also like to thank the various vendors who are representing adult education here at the conference and their generous donations.  I want to thank those who advocate for adult education in Colorado and at the White house level.  Most of all, I want to thank you, the Colorado educator.  Without your dedication and commitment to students, there would not be a clear pathway to a better future.

Please enjoy this conference and feel free to contact any of the CAEPA directors for anything; we are here for you.

Your CAEPA president,
