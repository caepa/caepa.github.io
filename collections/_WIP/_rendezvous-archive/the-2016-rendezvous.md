Friends and Colleagues:

On behalf of the Board of Directors and as President of CAEPA for 2016, I want to welcome you to Westminster, Colorado and to the Rendezvous Conference of 2016.

As we gather for the conference we look around at all the smiling faces from our colleagues, most are probably familiar and some are new. We share with one another the successes and the challenges of our past year. We also share ideas of what works and what does not. This is not only networking at its best but the connections we make are invaluable and forever- lasting.

Teachers are the core of education and even though we are paid less than we deserve, we are still one of the most notable and respected professions in the world. We are charged to make a difference in the lives of our students. We are charged to work with our partners; so, together we can make a difference in our economic well-being. We have been challenged to become creative and innovative in our methods of delivering instruction so that our learners can stay motivated in their difficult lives.

Our challenges are many and as we seek knowledge beyond our limits, let us reach to each other and not forget our purpose.

Every person who desires the opportunity to learn should be encouraged to NEVER GIVE UP...

Thank You,
