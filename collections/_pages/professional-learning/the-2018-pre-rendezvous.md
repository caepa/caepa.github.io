Ambassadors become representational leaders by developing their voices, so they can effectively represent other students and take action for social change on issues they care about.

CAEPA's Student Ambassadors Task Force wants to establish teams of trainers from programs around the state:

Director/Administrator + Staff/Instructor + Student Leadership

**Ambassador Training 4 Components**

Awareness
: Statistics and research about the value of adult basic education

Stories

Public speaking

Meeting with officials
